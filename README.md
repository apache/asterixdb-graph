# Property Graphs on AsterixDB: Graphix
Graphix is an extension for the Big Data Management System Apache AsterixDB that allows users to issue graph queries on conceptual graphs over existing data managed by AsterixDB itself. Our motto is “one analyst’s document store is another analyst’s graph”, originating from the thought that developers shouldn’t have to choose between two different technologies (i.e. a document database or a graph database).

See our website [here](https://graphix.ics.uci.edu) for more details.
